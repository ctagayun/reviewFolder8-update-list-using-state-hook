  Task:
    Incorporate bootstrap 

  Setup: 
    npm install bootstrap
    Once the installation is complete, we can include it in our appâ€™s 
    entry file in main.jsx :
    --  Bootstrap CSS
    import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
    -- Bootstrap Bundle JS
    import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min";

    Now since we created the project with Vite, we can rely 
    on Vite's plugins to integrate ESLint properly. Run the 
    following command
       npm install vite-plugin-eslint --save-dev

    install uuid node package 
       npm install uuid

//Create a custom hook called "useStorageState". We will use two hooks

//The actual return value of our custom hook will be displayed in the
//search box.

  //We start off with a complex state object which has the list as one of its properties.

  //Before we can add an item, we need to track the "input field's" state,
  //because without the value from the input field, we don't have any text
  //to give the item which we want to add to our list. So let's add some
  //state management to this first:
  const [title, setTitle] = React.useState("");

  //Function to delete a a record from the initialList list

    //spread operator  (...) to spread all key/value pairs from the state object into
    //the new state object, while overriding the list property with the new list.
    updateInitialList({ ...updatedList, list: newList });
  };

  //Function to handle add a record
  //Next, whenever someone clicks the Add button in renderListUsingArrowFunction.jsx ,
  //we can add the title entered into the input field as a new item to the list:

  const handleAddRecord = () => {

    //updatedList is the useState state variable
    //list: is the property name of the complex object. we need to
    //use list: newList because "newList" was derived from "list"

    //We could set both, the new list and the boolean flag -- which didn't change
    // -- explicitly, but in this case we are using JavaScript's spread
    //operator  (...) to spread all key/value pairs from the state object into
    //the new state object, while overriding the list property with the new list.
